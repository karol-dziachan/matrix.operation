# matrix.operation
This is my study programs, in which I had to program matrix operations


The application allows you to transform matrices. I think, that the most interesting in this project is reading matrix from file. My application checks the dimensions, if each character is a number, and also deals with other errors.

The errors are report by codes to CError, and while the program exits the codes are translating to text in output file. 

Operations:
-add
-subtraction
-multiply
-calculate scalar
-transposition
-read from file
-get/set matrix element
/create a vector from the given row or column

Constructor:
-without parametr (use default dimension and default value inside matrix)
-with dimension (use default value in matrix)
-with path to file
